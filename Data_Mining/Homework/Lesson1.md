# Lesson 1

## Excercises 1.9

1. What is *data mining*? In your answer, address the following:

   - Is it another hype?
   - Is it a simple transformation ar application of technology developed from *databases*, *statistics*, *machine learing*, and *pattern recognition*?
   - We have presented a view that data mining is the result of the evolution of *database technology*. Do you think that data mining is also the result of the evolution of *machine learning research*? Can you present such views based on the historical progress of this discipline? Address the same of the fields of *statistics* and *pattern recognition*.
   - Describe the steps involved in data mining when viewed as a process of knowledge discovery.

   > Data Mining is a process which finding knowledge in a large amount of data by calculation, statistics or analysis.
   >
   > It isn’t a hype, but a trend and aspect. With an increase of data, there should be a way to help us solve these huge amount of data.
   >
   > Data mining comes from database analysis, machine learning and pattern recognition. But it isn’t a simply transformation and application. It needs co-operation with plenty of subjects. Statistics, mathematics and artificial intelligence all support the rapid development of data mining.
   >
   > It’s not only the result of database technology development, but also the result of the researching evolution of machine learning. In the past, the size of a database isn’t large enough for data mining so we can’t find any key messages in those data. But with the increasing of data size, there should be another way for us to discover knowledges in data. Since then, data mining technology appeared. So do statistics and pattern recognition.
   >
   > When we regard data mining as a process of knowledge discovery, it should make data be cleaned, integrated, selected, transformed and consolidated, which they called preprocessing. Then we mine these data and evaluate patterns. After all work has done, we should present our knowledges which discovered by data mining.

2. How is a *data warehouse* different from a *database*? How are they similar?

   > Database is a collection of interrelated data. Most of the time, our database is relational. A relational database consists of plenty of tables. Every record stored in a row and each of its attributes splits into columns.
   >
   > Data warehouse, however, is a repository of information collected from multiple resources, stored under a unified schema, and usually residing at a single site.
   >
   > Data warehouses are similar to databases. They all store data in disks and provide APIs for data miners to use. But data in warehouses comes from multiple sources and has been combined and preprocessed. They aren’t original data.

## Figure 2.1

1. Combine the three pictures below to discuss the circumstances under which the three lines move. What is the law of their movement?

   > When the sum of all data becomes lower, the *mean* and *median* value will also become lower. When the sum of all data becomes higher, the *mean* and *median* value will also become higher. Both *mean* and *median* are sensitive.
   >
   > But *mode* isn't as sensitive as above. When most of the data become lower, *mode* becomes lower. When most of the data became larger, *mode* becomes larger.
