# Lesson 2

1. Suppose that the data for analysis includes the attribute *age*. The *age* values for the data tuples are (in increasing order) `13, 15, 16, 16, 19, 20, 20, 21, 22, 22, 25, 25, 25, 25, 30, 33, 33, 35, 35, 35, 35, 36, 40, 45, 46, 52, 70`.

   1. What is the *mean* of the data? What is the *median*?
      > The *mean* of the data is $\frac{13+15+16+\cdots+70}{27}\approx29.963$.
      > The *medain* of the data is $27$.

   2. What is the *mode* of the data? Commnet on the data's modality (i.e., bimodal, trimodal, etc.).
      > The *mode* of the data is $25$ and $35$.
      > Because there're 2 *mode*s in the data, so it's a bimodal.

   3. What is the *midrange* of the data?
      > The *midrange* of the data is $\frac{13+70}{2}=41.5$

   4. Can you find (roughly) the first quartile ($Q_1$) and the third quartile ($Q_3$) of the data?
      > The index of the first quartile is $\frac{27}{4}\approx7$, so $Q_1=20$. The index of the third quartile is $3\times7=21$, so $Q_3=35$.

   5. Give the *five-number summary* of the data.
      > Accroding to the results above, we get:
      > $$\begin{cases} Q_1=20 \\ M_{0.5}=25 \\ Q_3=35 \\ IQR=Q_3-Q_1=15 \\ 1.5IQR=22.5 \\ M_{\infty}=Q_3+1.5IQR=57.5 \\ M_{-\infty}=Q_1-1.5IQR=-2.5 \end{cases}$$

   6. Show a *boxplot* of the data.

   7. How is a *quantile-quantile plot* different from a *quantile plot*?
      > A *Quantile Plot* is a simple and effective way to observe the distribution of univariate data. First it shows the distribution of all the data for a given attribute; second, it plots the quantile information (i.e., for an ordinal or numeric attribute $X$, let $X_i\;(i=1,2,\cdots,N)$ be sorted in ascending order. The data is such that $X_1$ is the smallest observation and $X_n$ is the largest observation).
      > The *quantile-quantile plot* reflects the distribution of data for different samples of the same attribute, making it easy for users to compare the differences or associations between the two samples.
